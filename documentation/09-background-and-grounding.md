# Background and grounding

I began learning to program in 1997, very early, in an environment with limited resources.
That early start meant working close to fundamentals before modern abstractions and automated tools became common.

I was exposed to multiple generations of computing, from the 1980s onward.
This perspective shaped how I think about change, continuity, and what remains stable in software.

Early on I experienced guidance rooted in a rigorous scientific tradition and early computing systems.
That exposure helped form a calm, structured way of reasoning that still guides how I analyze problems and make decisions today.
