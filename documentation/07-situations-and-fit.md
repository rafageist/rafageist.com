# Situations and fit

## Who this space welcomes
- Early talent (approx 11-15): strong curiosity, basic digital familiarity, and the maturity to reason about problems, not just follow steps.
- Pre university mentees (16+): preparing for software engineering studies and building foundations before coursework begins.
- University mentees: filling gaps in algorithms, data structures, and systems reasoning.
- Early career mentees: strengthening design and architecture when systems start to matter.
- Explorers with vocation: not yet programming, but comfortable using a computer and ready to commit time and effort to see if software engineering is a fit.

## Common situations I help with
- "I can build features, but I do not really understand the system behind them."
- "I follow tutorials, but I struggle to make design decisions on my own."
- "I know tools and languages, but data flow and APIs still feel confusing."
- "When something breaks, I do not know where to start looking."
- "University courses move fast, but skip how to reason about real systems."
- "I get results, but I cannot clearly explain why they work."

## When this tends to help
- When you want to understand ideas, not just patch problems.
- When you are open to questioning what you think you know.
- When you can describe where you get lost, even if it feels basic.
- When you prefer a steady pace over hype or shortcuts.

## When this is not a fit
- When you mainly want tasks executed for you.
- When you want quick output without explanation.
- When you are not ready to slow down and examine assumptions.
- When you need digital literacy or basic computer use support.

## Fit signals

| Likely fit | Likely not a fit |
| --- | --- |
| You want clarity and judgment | You want rapid output only |
| You are willing to explain your reasoning | You want answers without reasoning |
| You accept steady iteration | You want a fast, fixed curriculum |
| You are comfortable using a computer | You need help with basic computer use |
