# Mentoring process

Mentoring follows a simple, iterative loop driven by real problems.
There is no fixed curriculum. The loop repeats as new questions surface.

## The loop

```
Clarify -> Diagnose -> Decide -> Build -> Review
   ^-----------------------------------------|
```

Each step is lightweight. We move forward, then loop back when new gaps appear.
Mentoring is not instruction and not problem solving on behalf of the mentee.
It is a shared process where both roles actively participate in understanding, reasoning, and decision making.
The mentor guides reasoning and challenges assumptions. The mentee owns execution and the artifacts.

## Step details

### Clarify the problem
We slow down and define the actual question. This includes context, constraints, and what "done" means.

### Diagnose gaps
We identify what is missing: concepts, assumptions, data, or reasoning steps that are not yet solid.

### Decide next steps
We pick a direction that makes the most sense now. This includes priorities, experiments, and tradeoffs.

### Build and test
We implement or test ideas directly in the tools. The goal is to expose behavior, not just produce output.

### Review decisions
We explain what was done and why. If reasoning is weak, we revisit the earlier steps.

### Iterate
New questions surface, and the loop begins again with more clarity.

## Summary table

| Step | Purpose | Typical outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clarify | Define the real problem | Problem statement, constraints, assumptions |
| Diagnose | Find gaps and unknowns | Missing concepts, risks, open questions |
| Decide | Choose the next move | Plan, priorities, next experiment |
| Build | Test ideas in practice | Code, tests, observations |
| Review | Explain and challenge decisions | Notes, revisions, tradeoff analysis |
| Iterate | Update the model | Refined understanding, new questions |

## Typical session flow
Sessions are exploratory by design. The goal is not to reach an answer quickly, but to make reasoning visible and identify what needs to be understood next.
- Revisit the current problem and context.
- Make reasoning explicit by asking focused questions.
- Work through the relevant artifact together.
- Decide the next action and the expected signal of progress.
- Capture decisions and open questions for the next loop.

## Example short exchange

```
mentee: i can write code but still feel lost
mentor: what feels unclear
mentee: i dont really know what im building
mentor: what do you think the system is supposed to do
mentee: thats the problem, im not sure
```
