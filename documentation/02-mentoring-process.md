# Mentoring process

The work follows a simple, iterative loop:

- The mentee brings a goal or a problem.
- The mentor diagnoses gaps and context.
- The mentor proposes a learning strategy.
- The mentee executes and produces artifacts.
- The mentor reviews, challenges, and evaluates.
- The loop continues until the work reaches the expected quality.

No formal methodology is assumed. The process stays human, practical, and responsive to the mentee's situation.
