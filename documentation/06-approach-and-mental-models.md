# Approach and mental models

## How I approach learning software engineering
I stay with what feels unclear instead of moving past it.
Understanding comes from identifying missing pieces and rebuilding ideas from simple building blocks.

This is not a branded method. It is how I work: plain language, reusable ideas, and one to one guidance adapted to each person and context.

## Engineering foundations
Engineering rests on core foundations that shape how problems are modeled and solved.
- Mathematics: structure, abstraction, precision.
- Logic: consistency, reasoning, validity.
- Discrete structures: graphs, relations, algorithms.
- Statistics and probability: uncertainty, data, decisions.
- Numerical methods: approximation, stability, error.
- Systems thinking: interactions, boundaries, trade offs.
- Research methodology: hypotheses, evidence, validation.
- Constraints and trade offs: limits, priorities, choices.

## Building a mental model
A mental model is a working explanation of how a system behaves.
We build it iteratively, not all at once.

```
Observation -> Hypothesis -> Test -> Revision -> Model
   ^----------------------------------------------|
```

### Signals that the model is missing
- You can follow steps but cannot explain why they work.
- Results appear correct but are not trustworthy.
- When something breaks, you do not know where to start.

## Reasoning before tools
Tools and frameworks are secondary to understanding.
AI can accelerate output, but it does not create understanding.
We use tools to test ideas, not to replace judgment.
