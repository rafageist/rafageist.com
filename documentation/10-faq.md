# FAQ

## Is this a course or a curriculum?
No. It is one to one mentoring based on your current problems and goals.

## Do you write code for me?
No. The work is to build your reasoning and decision making. You own the execution and artifacts.

## Is this about tools or languages?
Tools are used as needed, but understanding comes first. The focus is on reasoning and mental models.

## Can I use AI tools?
Yes, but only if you can explain why the output is correct. AI does not replace understanding.

## Who is this for?
Early talent (approx 11-15) with basic digital familiarity, pre university mentees (16+), university mentees, early career engineers, and people exploring software engineering with clear vocation who are comfortable using a computer.

## Do I need to know how to program?
No. You can be early in your path, but you should be comfortable using a computer and willing to commit time and effort to build real understanding. This is not digital literacy or basic computer use.

## What if I only need tasks executed?
Then this is not a fit. The work is about understanding and judgment.

## What is the first step?
Start with the short guided reflection to draft a message. You can send it through the channel you prefer.
