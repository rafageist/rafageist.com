# FAQ

## Is this a course or a curriculum?
No. It is one-to-one mentoring based on your current problems and goals.

## Do you write code for me?
No. The work is to build your reasoning and decision-making. You own the execution and artifacts.

## Is this about tools or languages?
Tools are used as needed, but understanding comes first. The focus is on reasoning and mental models.

## Can I use AI tools?
Yes, but only if you can explain why the output is correct. AI does not replace understanding.

## Who is this for?
Pre-university mentees (16+), university mentees, and early career engineers who want steady, serious guidance.

## What if I only need tasks executed?
Then this is not a fit. The work is about understanding and judgment.

## What is the first step?
Start with the short guided reflection to draft a message. You can send it through the channel you prefer.
