# Public Mentoring Documentation

This is the public documentation for Rafa Rodriguez, a one to one software engineering mentor.
It explains what the mentorship is, how the process works, what day to day collaboration looks like, and what to expect.

This documentation is public. It is written for prospective mentees and anyone evaluating the approach.
It is not a course outline or a marketing brochure.

## How to use this documentation
- Start with document 01 (Overview) for the core intent and boundaries.
- Read document 02 (Mentoring process) for the iterative loop and session flow.
- Use documents 03 (Practice and feedback) and 04 (Workspace and artifacts) for day to day work.
- See documents 07 (Situations and fit) and 10 (FAQ) to decide fit and next steps.

## Guiding idea
Working code is not the same as understanding. The focus is on reasoning, cause and effect, and decisions that can be explained.
