# Public Mentoring Documentation

This is the public documentation for Rafa Rodriguez, a one-to-one software engineering mentor.
It explains what the mentorship is, how the process works, what day to day collaboration looks like, and what to expect.

This documentation is public. It is written for prospective mentees and anyone evaluating the approach.
It is not a course outline or a marketing brochure.

## How to use this documentation
- Start with 01-overview.md for the core intent and boundaries.
- Read 02-mentoring-process.md for the iterative loop and session flow.
- Use 03-practice-and-feedback.md and 04-workspace-and-artifacts.md for day to day work.
- See 07-situations-and-fit.md and 10-faq.md to decide fit and next steps.

## Guiding idea
Working code is not the same as understanding. The focus is on reasoning, cause and effect, and decisions that can be explained.
