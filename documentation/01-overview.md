# Overview

This mentorship develops engineering judgment under constraint, ambiguity, and responsibility.
It is one to one guidance focused on reasoning, mental models, and decision making.

The goal is not just to make things work. The goal is to understand why they work and what the tradeoffs are.
That clarity is what makes decisions defensible over time.

AI tools can help with speed and recall, but they do not replace reasoning.
The mentee still needs a clear model of cause and effect before trusting results.

Structure is not the same as information. Many people get stuck not because of intelligence or effort,
but because their learning is fragmented. Guidance exists to build structure, not just accumulate content.

## Core principles
- Clarity before execution.
- Decisions must be explainable, not just repeatable.
- Real problems drive the work, not a fixed curriculum.
- Feedback is part of the work, not an add on.
- Artifacts exist to make reasoning visible.

## What this is and what it is not

| This is | This is not |
| --- | --- |
| One to one engineering guidance | A course platform or tutorial marketplace |
| Focused on reasoning and mental models | A shortcut to ship code without understanding |
| Iterative work on real problems | A fixed syllabus or standardized track |
| Calm, steady pace and critical feedback | Hype driven, sales oriented content |
| Shared responsibility for decisions | Outsourced problem solving |
| Engineering guidance for people who can use a computer | Digital literacy or basic computer use |
