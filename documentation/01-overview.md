# Overview

This mentorship develops engineering judgment under constraint, ambiguity, and responsibility. It is not casual or exploratory learning.

Output-driven learning can produce working code without understanding. Understanding-driven engineering requires decisions that can be explained and defended. Working code is insufficient when reasoning is unclear.

AI tools can assist with speed and recall, but they do not replace reasoning. The mentee must still build a clear model of cause and effect before trusting results.
