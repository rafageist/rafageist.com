# Getting started

The primary entry point on the site is "Start here".
It opens a short guided reflection that helps you compose an initial message.
There is no commitment required.
The reflection assumes basic digital familiarity and comfort using a computer.

## What the reflection does
- Makes your current situation explicit.
- Captures what feels unclear or unstable.
- Produces a draft message you can copy or send.

## What to include in your message
- Where you are right now and what feels unclear.
- What you already tried and what did not work.
- The kind of guidance you think would help most.

## What happens next
- We review the message and clarify the problem together.
- We decide the first small, concrete step.
- The mentorship proceeds through the iterative loop described in 02-mentoring-process.md.
