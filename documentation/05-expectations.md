# Expectations

## From the mentee
- Consistent effort, preparation, and follow-through
- Honesty about what is unclear and what was assumed
- Willingness to revise and refine thinking
- Incomplete reasoning or hand-wavy explanations will be challenged
- Discomfort is part of the process

## From the mentor
- Critical evaluation of reasoning and decisions
- Questioning assumptions and testing explanations
- Rejecting insufficient explanations and asking for revision
- Clear guidance and structured challenge
- The mentor is not responsible for the mentee's motivation or pace

This is a professional relationship. Progress depends on sustained engagement. Not every mentee will find this approach suitable.
