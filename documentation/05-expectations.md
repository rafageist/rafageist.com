# Expectations

Mentoring works when both sides are explicit and consistent.
This is a professional relationship focused on clarity and responsibility.

## From the mentee
- Consistent effort, preparation, and follow through.
- Honesty about what is unclear and what was assumed.
- Willingness to revise and refine thinking.
- Incomplete reasoning will be challenged.
- Discomfort is part of the process.

## From the mentor
- Critical evaluation of reasoning and decisions.
- Questioning assumptions and testing explanations.
- Clear guidance and structured challenge.
- Refusal to accept unclear or hand wavy explanations.
- The mentor is not responsible for the mentee's motivation or pace.

## Shared expectations
- Show your thinking, even when it is incomplete.
- Keep decisions tied to evidence and context.
- Make progress visible through artifacts.
- Stay engaged between sessions.

## Boundaries
- This is not a replacement for formal education or employment.
- This is not outsourced problem solving.
- The goal is understanding and judgment, not fast output.
