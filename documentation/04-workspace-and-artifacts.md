# Workspace and artifacts

GitHub is used as the shared workspace to keep the work visible and durable.
Artifacts are not a byproduct. They are how reasoning becomes traceable.

## Primary artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository | Single source of truth | Code, notes, experiments |
| Issues | Capture questions and review points | Open problems, decisions to revisit |
| Commits | Traceability of change | Why a change happened, not just what |
| Documentation | Preserve context | Decision notes, summaries |
| Diagrams and sketches | Make models visible | Flows, boundaries, dependencies |

## How artifacts are used
- Every meaningful decision should leave a trail.
- Notes are short, clear, and tied to real work.
- The goal is to make progress auditable, not to create paperwork.

## Why this matters
When reasoning is captured, it can be tested, challenged, and improved.
That is how understanding compounds over time.
