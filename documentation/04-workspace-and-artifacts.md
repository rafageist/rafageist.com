# Workspace and artifacts

GitHub is used as the shared workspace to keep the work visible and durable:

- Repositories hold the working code and notes
- Issues capture questions, tasks, and review points
- Commits provide traceability of decisions and changes
- Documentation preserves context and outcomes

This structure creates accountability and makes progress auditable over time.
