# Practice and feedback

Mentoring happens inside real tools and real working environments.
Work continues between sessions, and the feedback loop stays active.

## Day to day collaboration

| Channel | Used for | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chat | Short questions, quick updates | Clarifications, short notes |
| Video sessions | Live walkthroughs and shared screens | Decisions, next steps |
| Shared whiteboard | Sketching flows and models | Diagrams, problem framing |
| IDEs | Working directly in code | Implementations, refactors |
| Version control | Tracking changes and reasoning | Commits, history, context |
| Production environments | Seeing real behavior | Observations, constraints |
| Learning resources | Targeted references | Notes, reading lists |
| Asynchronous notes | Thinking between sessions | Written reasoning, summaries |

## Feedback is part of the work
Producing code is not enough. The mentee is expected to explain decisions, tradeoffs, and intent.
Review and feedback are central to the work, not optional extras.

### What feedback looks like
- Questions that make assumptions explicit.
- Requests to explain why a choice makes sense.
- Small tests that expose cause and effect.
- Rewriting explanations until they are clear and durable.
- Identifying what is known versus what is guessed.
