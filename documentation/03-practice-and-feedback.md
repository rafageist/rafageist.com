# Practice and feedback

Practice happens through shared work:

- Screen sharing for live walkthroughs
- Code reviews and guided debugging
- Terminal sessions for execution and inspection
- Written explanations to confirm reasoning

Producing code is not enough. The mentee is expected to explain decisions, tradeoffs, and intent. Review and feedback are central to the work, not optional extras.
