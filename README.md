# Rafa Rodríguez
_Senior Software Engineering Mentor_

## What this mentorship is
This repository describes a 1-to-1 software engineering mentorship focused on reasoning, judgment, and decision-making. It is not a course catalog and it does not center on tools or frameworks. The work is practical and applied, grounded in the mentee's goals and constraints.

This is not a substitute for a diploma. It is a serious, structured engineering formation. No degrees, certificates, or formal credentials are issued.

## Who this is for
This is for mentees who want to deepen their engineering judgment, strengthen fundamentals, and learn how to make sound decisions under practical constraints. It can serve as a formative path for mentees without formal engineering training, even without degrees.

## How we work
Mentoring is one-to-one and iterative. A mentee brings a goal or a problem, the mentor helps diagnose gaps, and both work through a focused path of learning, practice, and review. Progress is driven by clarity and evidence, not by speed.

The mentor evaluates reasoning and decisions. Feedback can be critical. Progress is not guaranteed without effort. The mentee is expected to take responsibility for outcomes, not just participate in discussions.

## Why GitHub is part of the process
GitHub is the primary workspace for organization, documentation, and feedback. Repositories, issues, and commit history make the work visible, reviewable, and traceable over time.
