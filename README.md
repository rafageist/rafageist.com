_Senior Software Engineering Mentor_

## What this mentorship is
This repository describes a 1-to-1 software engineering mentorship focused on reasoning, judgment, and decision-making. It is not a course catalog and it does not center on tools or frameworks. The work is practical and applied, grounded in the mentee's goals and constraints.

This is not a substitute for a diploma. It is a serious, structured engineering formation. No degrees, certificates, or formal credentials are issued.

## Who this is for
This is for mentees who want to deepen their engineering judgment, strengthen fundamentals, and learn how to make sound decisions under practical constraints. It can serve as a formative path for mentees without formal engineering training, even without degrees. You do not need to be a programmer yet, but you should be comfortable using a computer and willing to commit time and effort to develop real software engineering judgment. This is not digital literacy or basic computer use.

Typical fit includes:
- Early talent (approx 11-15) with basic digital familiarity and the maturity to reason about problems.
- Pre-university mentees (16+) preparing for software engineering studies.
- University mentees filling gaps in algorithms, data structures, and systems reasoning.
- Early career mentees strengthening design and architecture as systems start to matter.
- Explorers with vocation who are comfortable using a computer and ready to commit time and effort, even if they are not programming yet.

## How we work
Mentoring is one-to-one and iterative. A mentee brings a goal or a problem, the mentor helps diagnose gaps, and both work through a focused path of learning, practice, and review. Progress is driven by clarity and evidence, not by speed.

The mentor evaluates reasoning and decisions. Feedback can be critical. Progress is not guaranteed without effort. The mentee is expected to take responsibility for outcomes, not just participate in discussions.

## Why GitHub is part of the process
GitHub is the primary workspace for organization, documentation, and feedback. Repositories, issues, and commit history make the work visible, reviewable, and traceable over time.
