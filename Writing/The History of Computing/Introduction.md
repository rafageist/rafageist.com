It is not known for certain what the oldest calculating tool is, as ancient civilizations used a variety of methods and objects to perform calculations and keep numerical records.

The abacus is the oldest formal device we know of that has survived, but before its invention, people used natural objects such as stones, sticks, shells, or made marks on bones to count and perform simple calculations. These methods were more rudimentary and have not left traces as obvious or sophisticated as the abacus.

The Ishango bone, for example, discovered in Africa, dates back around 20,000 years. This bone has marks that many experts interpret as evidence of some kind of counting or calculation, making it an older tool than the abacus.

However, there is no absolute consensus on whether it was used for that purpose or if it represented something else. This leaves some room for speculation as to what exactly the first formal calculating tool was. What we do know is that the need to count and perform basic operations with numbers is a very ancient skill, and humans have been devising ingenious ways to do it since prehistoric times.
