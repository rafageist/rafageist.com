The pre-history of computers refers to the period before the development of electronic or mechanical computing machines, when human beings relied on simple tools and methods to perform calculations. The earliest known calculating device is the abacus, which marks the beginning of this era. The abacus, used as early as 2000 BCE in ancient Mesopotamia and later in other civilizations such as China, Greece, and Rome, is considered one of the most enduring and influential tools for performing arithmetic operations [1].

## The Abacus: Humanity's First Calculator

The abacus is a simple manual tool made up of beads or stones moved along rods or grooves to represent numbers. It was designed to assist in performing basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Despite its simplicity, the abacus was highly efficient and remained a widely used tool for many centuries, especially in commerce and trade, where quick calculations were essential [2].

While the exact origins of the abacus are difficult to pinpoint, its use spread across different cultures, each adapting the device to their own needs. The Chinese *abacus*, or *suanpan*, for example, was particularly sophisticated, featuring a two-tiered system that allowed users to perform a wide range of calculations quickly and accurately [3]. The Roman abacus, meanwhile, employed a slightly different structure but was used for similar purposes in commerce and engineering [4].

The lasting significance of the abacus lies not only in its practical utility but also in the fact that it represents one of the earliest attempts to automate and systematize mathematical calculations. The structure and logic of the abacus allowed users to offload cognitive load, making complex arithmetic faster and less error-prone [5].

## Early Mechanical Aids to Calculation

While the abacus remained the dominant tool for calculations throughout much of history, the desire to create more advanced methods of computation began to emerge by the 17th century. Mechanical devices such as Napier’s Bones (1617) and Wilhelm Schickard’s calculating clock (1623) were developed as aids to assist with more complex mathematical operations, including multiplication and division [6]. These devices used physical components—such as rotating gears or marked rods—to facilitate calculations, marking the beginning of the transition from manual to mechanical computation.

John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, also introduced logarithms, which simplified complex calculations, particularly multiplication and division, by converting them into addition and subtraction problems [7]. Although logarithms were primarily a mathematical concept, they laid the groundwork for future computational tools.

These early innovations, while limited in their capacity, represent humanity’s growing interest in automating calculations. They foreshadowed the eventual development of more complex mechanical and, later, electronic machines that would revolutionize the way people approached computation.

Legacy of the Pre-History Era
Though rudimentary compared to modern computers, the abacus and these early mechanical devices laid critical groundwork for the development of computing. They demonstrated that it was possible to use external tools to perform logical, repeatable operations—an idea that would eventually evolve into the foundation of programmable machines [8]. The notion that human thought processes could be represented and manipulated through physical objects, such as beads on an abacus or gears in a mechanical clock, helped shift the perception of calculation from a purely intellectual exercise to one that could be aided by machines [9].

The abacus and its counterparts persisted as important educational and business tools well into the modern era. Even today, the abacus is still used in some parts of the world for teaching basic arithmetic, as it provides a hands-on understanding of numerical operations and place value that is difficult to replicate with more abstract, modern methods [10].

In conclusion, the pre-history of computers is characterized by humanity’s early attempts to create external devices to assist with mathematical operations. Beginning with the abacus, these tools helped pave the way for the more complex mechanical calculators that would follow, and ultimately, the development of the first true computers. The abacus symbolizes the start of this journey, demonstrating that even the simplest devices can have a profound impact on the evolution of technology.
