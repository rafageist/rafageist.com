## Education

My educational background is dedicated to various areas relevant to software development and technology:

- **Operations Research**: My thesis was a system for generating schedules for universities and schools, developed in PHP with PostgreSQL and PL/pgSQL. This work included mathematical modeling and researching algorithms, culminating in the creation of a new algorithm based on dynamic programming. This was a second version of a similar system I had previously developed in Visual Basic 6 during my studies.
- **Business Process Administration**: I studied tools and methodologies for effective business process management.
- **Content Management Systems**: I have specialized in systems such as Drupal.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: I worked on generating conceptual maps from text using AI techniques.
- **Model-Driven Architecture (MDA)**: Focused on Java Enterprise Environment technology.
- **Linux Server Administration and Network Configuration**: Actively participated in managing the university's network.
- **Data Warehouse Systems**: Developed systems to manage data for schools in my home country.

Additionally, I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering, where I gained a solid foundation in software engineering, algorithms, and data structures. During high school, I was part of high-performance computing groups focused on algorithm competitions and operations research, which led to my participation in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). In university, I continued to hone my skills and participated in the ACM ICPC programming competitions.

This comprehensive blend of formal education and hands-on experience has equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in software development and contribute effectively to any team.
